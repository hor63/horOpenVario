Basic Installation
==================

   First checkout all submodules running "git submodule init; git submodule update"

   Basically run the script "makenewimage.sh" in this directory.
This will create and update the image file sd.img in this directory.
Copy the image onto your micro-SD card with "dd if=sd.img of=<SDDev> bs=1M"
<SDDev> is the name of your SD card raw device, e.g. /dev/sdc

This creates a bootable SD card for your Cubieboard which will run the Ubuntu 16.04 LTS installer upon first startup.
It is sufficient to select basic software at the end of the Ubuntu installation process on the SD card.
Further steps are explained in the README contained in setup-ubuntu.tgz in the /boot directory after the installation.
