0. While the installation run perform these steps before you reboot into the installed Ubuntu system from the command line console (ALT-F2 or ALT-F3):
 - Copy the kernel modules. Verify that /target/modules already exists. Otherwise wait for the installer to create it.
   @cp -Rfp /lib/modules/3.4*  /target/modules"
   
 - Go to /target/boot.
   copy a boot script which does not load the installation initrd (e.g. boot.hdmi.scr or boot.initrd-noinst.scr) as boot.scr.
1.
After installing the Ubuntu Core (or copying the root FS) get the Wireless LAN to work:
- Edit /etc/network/interfaces. Be inspired by etc/network/interfaces how to setup wlan0 (or whatever the interface name is) to auto-configure with the wpa_supplicant.
  check in /sys/class/net what the name of your WLAN interface is, and adjust /etc/network/interfaces accordingly
- Copy and edit etc/wpa_supplicant.conf to /etc.
  goto /etc/wpa_suppplicant. search for 'wext'. Edit the files containing it to run wpa_supplicant only with wext, not with the additional 'nl80211' driver which fails with the 3.4 kernel.
- Edit /etc/wpa_supplicant/functions.sh change the path to the wpa_supplicant program to /usr/local/sbin/wpa_suppicant. 
  Typically it is defined in this line (already adjusted):
    WPA_SUP_BIN="/usr/local/sbin/wpa_supplicant"
  This is because the slightly older version works with the external Realtek driver for my RTL8192CU USB WLAN adapter, but the current wpa_supplicant from the Ubuntu updates does not.
reboot to get you new configuration to work with "sudo init 6"

2.
Now install all the packages you need for basic compilation of system libraries, and for XCSoar natively on the machine.
Run
cat ~/installed-packages.txt | sudo apt-get install -y 

3.
Now install lib-ump:
sudo dpkg -i mali/ump/libump_3.0-0sunxi1_armhf.deb

4.
Install the Mali OpenGL ES binary blob.
load the mali and ump modules:
sudo modprobe ump
sudo modprobe mali
Run lsmod to check if the modules have been loaded.
change to mali/mali. Run
sudo make install
to install the binary blob.
Copy etc/modules to /etc/modules or edit /etc/modules and add the entries in the local etc/modules (mali and ump) to be loaded at boot time.

5. 
 Grant read/write access to group 'video' to /dev/ump and /dev/mali:
sudo cp etc/udev/rules.d/50-mali.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

6.
Add yourself to the required groups to use the input devices, the Mali EGL and OpenGL ES libraries
./addUserToGroups.sh

7.
reboot with 
sudo init 6

Goto mali/mali/sunxi-mali/test. Run ./test. A smooth triangle should appear. To get back to the text screen enter:
exit
CTRL-C
Don't ask me why, but for me it works to re-initialize the screen to text mode. The only small downside is that you need to login back :)


Install/copy or compile XCSoar yourself.
Enjoy!
