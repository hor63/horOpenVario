Final steps after booting for the first time.

1.
Install and/or configure the network using nmtui or wicd (depening on your choice when building the image),
particularly logging into a WLan.

2. Add a normal user using adduser which you will be using from now on.

3.
Add yourself to the required groups to use the input devices, the Mali EGL and OpenGL ES libraries
./addUserToGroups.sh

4. 
Goto mali/mali/sunxi-mali/test. Run ./test. A smooth triangle should appear. To get back to the text screen enter:
exit
CTRL-C
Don't ask me why, but for me it works to re-initialize the screen to text mode. The only small downside is that you need to login back :)


Install/copy or compile XCSoar yourself.
Enjoy!
