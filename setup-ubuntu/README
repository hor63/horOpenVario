1.
After installing the Ubuntu Core (or copying the root FS) get the Wireless LAN to work:
Edit /etc/network/interfaces. Be inspired by etc/network/interfaces how to setup wlan0 (or whatever the interface name is) to auto-configure with the wpa_supplicant.
check in /sys/class/net what the name of your WLAN interface is, and adjust /etc/network/interfaces accordingly
Copy and edit etc/wpa_supplicant.conf to /etc.
goto /etc/wpa_suppplicant. search for 'wext'. Edit the files containing it to run wpa_supplicant only with wext, not with the additional 'nl80211' driver which fails with the 3.4 kernel.
reboot to get you new configuration to work.
sudo init 6

2.
Now install all the packages you need for basic compilation of system libraries, and for XCSoar natively on the machine.
Run
cat ~/installed-packages.txt | sudo apt-get install -y 

3.
Now install lib-ump:
sudo dpkg -i mali/ump/libump_3.0-0sunxi1_armhf.deb

4.
Install the Mali OpenGL ES binary blob.
load the mali and ump modules:
sudo modprobe ump
sudo modprobe mali
Run lsmod to check if the modules have been loaded.
change to mali/mali/sunxi-mali. Run
sudo make install
to install the binary blob.
Copy etc/modules to /etc/modules or edit /etc/modules and add the entries in the local etc/modules (mali and ump) to be loaded at boot time.

5. 
 Grant read/write access to group 'video' to /dev/ump and /dev/mali:
sudo cp etc/udev/rules.d/50-mali.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

6.
Add yourself to the required groups to use the input devices, the Mali EGL and OpenGL ES libraries
./addUserToGroups.sh

7.
reboot with 
sudo init 6

Goto mali/mali/sunxi-mali/test. Run ./test. A smooth triangle should appear. To get back to the text screen enter:
exit
CTRL-C
Don't ask me why, but for me it works to re-initialize the screen to text mode. The only small downside is that you need to login back :)


Install/copy or compile XCSoar yourself.
Enjoy!
